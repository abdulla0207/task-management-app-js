## About App:

This app was created for only CW purposes from Web Technology Module. The app is mainly for managing tasks. The user can create tasks with titles, descriptions, and priority. When the user will leave the text areas or will not choose the priority, the app will not create a task instead it will ask the user to fill the empty areas. When the task is created, under the ADD button there will be a link message that will redirect the user to their list of tasks. Also, it is possible to get there from the navigation bar "Tasks". On the tasks page, the user can track their tasks, and there are two buttons for every task. One is finished. And when the finish button is clicked the website will redirect the user to the homepage and there will be a message in red "Task is Removed". The second button is the Edit button. When the user clicks it, they will be able to edit their created tasks and save the changes.
